A Rammstein (German Band) completely covered in Apfelkuchen (Apple Cake) runs into an Flughafen (Airport) persued by a very hungry-looking Hund (Dog).
As he sprinted, he stumbled into a Biergarten (Beer Garden), knocking over a table full of Bratwurst (Grilled Sausage), Brot (Bread), and Bier (Beer).
Thankfully, the very hungry-looking Hund (Dog) preferred the Bratwurst (Grilled Sausage) over the Apfelkuchen (Apple Cake), which allowed the members of
Rammstein (German Band) to head to the gate for their flight to Berlin.

Jennifer At th gate of their flight, there was a wettbewerbsfaehig (Competitive) Rammstein (German Band) contest. 
While settling into their seats, the flight attendants announced that the in-flight meal would be Doener (Turkish kebab) and Apfelkuchen (apple cake), 
prompting thunderous applause.
As the plane lifted toward Berlin, a Dirndel (Traditional Dress) flapped out of the luggage hold like a flag of victory.
