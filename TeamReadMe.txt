Hello team,

For the Icebreaker assignment, I created the public repository
and a branch for each person.

Please follow these steps:

1. Create a folder named: WeissTeamStory
2. Open Git Bash inside that folder.
3. Run the following commands:

   git clone https://github.com/fanayaal/WeissTeamStory.git
   cd WeissTeamStory
   git checkout <your-branch-name>

From here, you can switch to your branch and add
your portion of the story to story.txt.
.
Thank you!
